Two-columnifying Forrst!
Developed by @elektrowolf, designed by @samm

We're...
1. Pushing the feed into two-columns in order to show more posts on screen at once
2. Re-arranging the post page into two columns (meaning both comments and the snap are visible at once!)
3. Making Forrst CSS3-friendly

Take a peek at how it looks so far: http://i.imgur.com/FKZxq.jpg
